# Reminder App :clipboard:

## Who made these marvelous things? :mortar_board:

We are the Project-X Group and this is our Reminder-App. We are `Dave` :turtle: and `Valerie` :honeybee:.
Have FUN with our Project.


## How do we use it?

You need a delightful IDE like CLion (or what do u think is a attractive IDE?) and a enjoyable browser like `Brave`,`Vivaldi` or `Firefox`. The recommended screen resolution is 1920 x 1080.<br />
In Firefox, unfortunately, the calendar is not displayed perfectly with the icon.<br />

## Design Questions - let's go, we can explain everything!

Our website should be modern, but also special like us. We followed the specifications and implemented them as we had imagined.<br /><br />
The main theme is the background with all its beautiful colors.:rainbow: The rest of the design is based on that. (A little surprise we also have: Can you find it or glitch it out of your hands. :sunglasses:)<br /><br />
You can create a list, change the title and of course delete the list again. You can only change the title by using the edit button. The cool thing about the edit button: It is invisible. You have to hover over the corresponding list to see the edit button.<br />
In your list you can create reminders, date them, set a flag to declare their importance and check them off.
You have 3 seconds to uncheck them.
After the 3 seconds counter is over, the reminder is deleted for eveeer :open_mouth:.<br />
You have a Today List and a Flag List where you can see what you have To-Do today and which reminders from all lists are most important to you.<br /><br />

If you have any other questions :interrobang: , simply write us. :love_letter: <br /><br />

Otherwise have fun with our reminder app.
Go ahead, write your To-Dos in it and get them done. :white_check_mark:
