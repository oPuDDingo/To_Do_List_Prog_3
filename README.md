# Reminder App :clipboard:

## Who made these marvelous things? :mortar_board:

We are the Project-X Group and this is our Reminder-App. We are `Dave` :turtle: and `Valerie` :honeybee:.
Have FUN with our Project.


## How do we use it?

You need a delightful IDE like CLion (or what do u think is a attractive IDE?) and a enjoyable browser like `Brave`,`Vivaldi` or `Firefox`. The screen resolution is recommended for 1920 x 1080.<br />
In Firefox, unfortunately, the calendar is not displayed perfectly with the icon.<br />

## Design Questions - let's go, we can explain everything!

Our website should be modern, but also special like us. We followed the specifications and implemented them as we had imagined.<br /><br />
The main feature should be the background with all its beautiful colors.:rainbow: The rest of the design is based on this. (A little surprise we also have, can you find it or glitch it out of your hands. :sunglasses:)<br /><br />
You can create a list, change the title and of course delete the list again. You can only change the title by using the edit button. The cool thing about the edit button is the invisibility. You have to hover over it to see it.<br />
In your list you can create reminders, date them, set a flag to declare the importance and check them off.
You have 3 seconds to uncheck them.
Of course, the counter will be displayed.<br />
You have a Today list and a Flag list where you see what you have to do today and which reminders from all lists are most important to you.<br /><br />

If you have any other questions :interrobang: , simply write us. :love_letter: <br /><br />

Otherwise have fun with our reminder app.
Go ahead, write your to do's in it and get them done. :white_check_mark:
