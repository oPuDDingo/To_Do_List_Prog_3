# Reminder App

***

## Who made these marvelous things?

We are the Project-X Group and this is our Reminder-App. We are `Dave` and `Valerie`.
Have FUN with our Project.


## How do we use it?

You need a delightful IDE like CLion (or what do u think is a attractive IDE?) and a enjoyable browser like `Brave`,`Vivaldi` or `Firefox`.<br />
In Firefox, unfortunately, the calendar is not displayed perfectly with the icon.<br />

## Design Questions - let's go, we can explaine everything!

Our website should be modern, but also special like us. We followed the specifications and implemented them as we had imagined.
The main feature should be the background with all its beautiful colors. The rest of the design is based on this.
